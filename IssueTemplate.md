## Transitioning [Directory Name] to TypeScript

### Description:
[Provide a brief description of the purpose of this directory and its contents.]

### Goals:
- [ ] Convert all JavaScript files to TypeScript.
- [ ] Ensure all components, functions, and variables have proper typings.
- [ ] Resolve any TypeScript compilation errors.
- [ ] Update import/export statements to TypeScript syntax.
- [ ] Refactor any necessary code to comply with TypeScript best practices.
- [ ] Ensure TypeScript strict mode is enabled and configured appropriately.

### Steps to Complete:
1. **Analysis:**
   - [ ] Identify all JavaScript files within the directory.

   - [ ] Enable TypeScript strict mode (`strict: true`).
   - [ ] Configure any necessary TypeScript options for the directory.

4. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - [ ] Test the application to ensure proper functionality after conversion.
   - [ ] Address and fix any TypeScript compilation errors.
   - [ ] Debug any runtime issues that arise from the transition.

5. **Documentation:**
